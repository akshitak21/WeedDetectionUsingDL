<h1>Weed Detection using Deep Learning</h1>

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for <b>weed detection in agricultural videos</b>. The workflow is designed to:

<t><b>Preprocess agricultural</b> video data into frames.</t>

Train and evaluate a deep learning model (CNN/transfer learning) for weed classification.

ðŸ“‚ Repository Contents

Model.ipynb

Defines and trains a PyTorch-based deep learning model for weed detection.

Uses transfer learning (torchvision.models) along with preprocessing pipelines (transforms).

Handles dataset loading with DataLoader and optimizes training with torch.optim.

WeedDetectionVideoConverter.ipynb

Converts input agricultural videos into frames for training/testing.

Uses OpenCV (cv2) for frame extraction and image handling.

Provides utilities for saving frames and optionally comparing frames using SSIM (structural similarity).

Supports Google Colab integration for file handling.
